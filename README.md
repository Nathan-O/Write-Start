Write start. 

Write start is a small, simple web application aimed at helping both emerging and seasoned writers get much needed feedback on that most important aspect of the story once it's ready to submit, the opener. Be it first scene or first chapter the beginning is what the publisher sees and judges, so it pays to make it the best.
