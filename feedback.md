##Comments
Nathan has achieve MVP with an original idea.  Less focus on GUI and more time spent on Routing/AJAX would produce successful results with Delete/Edit.  Submission schema compilation was uncommented, which might have produced errors in development.  Overall technical work shows proficiency.  While end goal wasn't achieved, Nathan was able to provide the necessary accomplishments.  I look forward to seeing this project in in Beta. - jc
